This is a demo application to present node.js application hosting on Scalarium.
Have a look at the branches to see how Scalarium provides you with access to a running mysql and memcached server in the same cloud.

You can use this application as a starting point for experiments with node.js on Scalarium, as soon as that feature is available.
